## Cognitive bias:


## 🧠 **Cognition & judgment (advanced)**

* **Curse of knowledge**: You forget what it was like to *not* know something—and therefore overestimate how much others understand.
* **Blind Spot Bias**: You believe that you are less affected by bias than others (meta-irony in the form of bias).
* **Information Bias**: You want more information, even if it is irrelevant to your decision.
* **Ambiguity Effect**: You avoid options whose probabilities are unclear.
* **Belief Bias**: You evaluate an argument based on whether you believe the conclusion – not on logic.
* **Base rate fallacy**: You ignore the base probability in favor of conspicuous (but rare) characteristics.
* **Zero-risk bias**: You prefer to eliminate a small risk entirely rather than greatly reduce a large one.
* **Disposition Effect**: In the financial world, you prefer to sell profitable investments rather than loss-making ones, even though this is irrational.
* **Hard-Easy Effect**: You underestimate difficult tasks and overestimate easy ones.

---

## 👁️‍🗨️ **Illusions & Perceptual Errors**

* **Illusory Superiority** (Above-Average Effect): You consider yourself above average in many things – mathematically impossible.
* **Illusory Correlation**: You perceive connections where there are none (e.g., stereotypical connections).
* **Illusion of Validity**: You are convinced that your predictions are accurate – even if they are based on weak data.
* **Placebo Effect**: You feel an effect simply because you expect it.
* **Nocebo Effect**: The opposite of the placebo effect – you experience *negative* effects simply because you expect them.
* **Mere Exposure Effect**: Repeated stimuli seem more familiar and therefore more positive.
* **Recency Illusion**: You think a phenomenon is new just because you have only just discovered it.
* **Hot-Hand Fallacy**: You believe that a player is on a “winning streak” – even though the statistics say otherwise.

### 🧩 **Clustering Illusion (also: Clustering Bias)**

> You recognize apparent patterns or clusters in random data—e.g., when rolling dice or in statistics—even though they are purely random.

---

### 🔗 **Conjunction Fallacy**

> You consider a specific combination (e.g., “bank employee and feminist”) to be more likely than the more general option (“just a bank employee”) – even though this is mathematically impossible.

---

### 🎯 **Regression to the mean**

> Extreme values (e.g., very poor or very good performance) tend to regress toward the mean statistically when repeated – but we often interpret this as a real trend or effect.

---

### ❤️‍🔥 **Affect Heuristic**

> Your spontaneous feelings (sympathy, fear, disgust, etc.) influence decisions more than objective facts or probabilities.
