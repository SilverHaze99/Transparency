# Transparency – List of Manipulations and Cognitive Biases

## Manipulation Techniques & Psychological Influence Tactics

1. **Door-in-the-Face**: Make a large request expected to be rejected, then follow with a smaller, more reasonable request that is more likely to be accepted.
2. **Hoovering**: Attempting to "suck back in" a former partner or associate through flattery, guilt, or false promises after a breakup or conflict.
3. **Zeigarnik Effect**: Incomplete or interrupted tasks are remembered better than completed ones, creating psychological tension that can be leveraged to maintain engagement.
4. **Scarcity Principle**: Creating perceived scarcity (limited time, quantity, or access) to increase perceived value and urgency.
5. **Placebo Effect**: A beneficial outcome produced by an inert treatment due to the recipient’s belief in its efficacy. *(Note: This is a psychological phenomenon, not inherently manipulative unless exploited.)*
6. **Framing Effect**: Presenting identical options in different ways (e.g., “90% fat-free” vs. “10% fat”) to influence decisions.
7. **Exploiting Emotional Contagion**: Deliberately expressing or amplifying emotions to influence others’ moods and decisions (e.g., feigning distress to gain compliance).
8. **Mirroring**: Subtly imitating another’s posture, speech, or gestures to build rapport and trust—often used in sales or interrogation.
9. **Divide and Conquer**: Sowing discord within a group to weaken collective resistance and increase individual susceptibility to control.
10. **Loss Aversion**: Emphasizing potential losses (rather than gains) to drive decisions, as losses psychologically weigh ~2x more than equivalent gains.
11. **Priming**: Exposing someone to subtle cues (words, images, contexts) that unconsciously influence later behavior or judgment.
12. **Power of Touch**: Brief, appropriate touch (e.g., on the arm) can increase likability, trust, and compliance.
13. **Halo Effect**: Assuming that because someone excels in one area (e.g., looks, charisma), they must be competent or virtuous in others.
14. **Low-Balling**: Securing agreement to a deal, then changing the terms (e.g., raising the price) after commitment has been made.
15. **Cognitive Dissonance Exploitation**: Creating inconsistency between beliefs and actions to pressure someone into changing their stance to restore psychological comfort.
16. **Inducing Groupthink**: Suppressing dissent in groups through pressure, isolation, or leadership dominance to enforce conformity.
17. **Confirmation Bias Exploitation**: Feeding someone only information that aligns with their existing beliefs to reinforce loyalty or prevent critical thinking.
18. **Illusion of Choice**: Offering multiple options that all lead to the same outcome or serve the manipulator’s interest.
19. **Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP)**: *(Controversial)* A set of communication techniques claiming to influence behavior through language patterns—lacks strong empirical support but is widely used in persuasion contexts.
20. **Artificial Urgency**: Fabricating time pressure (“Offer ends in 10 minutes!”) to bypass rational deliberation.
21. **Frequency Illusion (Baader-Meinhof Phenomenon)**: After noticing something new, it seems to appear everywhere—can be exploited via repeated exposure to normalize ideas.
22. **Subliminal Messaging**: Presenting stimuli below conscious awareness to influence attitudes or behavior (effectiveness is debated and often overstated).
23. **Foot-in-the-Door**: Starting with a small, easy request to increase compliance with a larger request later.
24. **Strategic Incompetence (“Playing Dumb”)**: Pretending ignorance to avoid tasks, extract help, or lower others’ guard.
25. **Love Bombing**: Overwhelming someone with affection, attention, and praise early in a relationship to create dependency and trust.
26. **Bandwagon Manipulation**: Promoting an idea or product as “everyone is doing it” to exploit conformity.
27. **Reframing Failure**: Presenting setbacks as “learning opportunities” to maintain morale or deflect accountability—can be healthy or manipulative depending on context.

36. **Authority Bias Exploitation**: Using titles, uniforms, or credentials to gain unwarranted trust or obedience.
37. **Mind Control**: *(Colloquial term)* Refers to extreme, sustained manipulation that overrides autonomous thought—more accurately described as coercive persuasion.
38. **False Identity Imposition**: Assigning or reinforcing a role/identity (e.g., “You’re the responsible one”) to constrain behavior.
39. **Social Proof Exploitation**: Highlighting others’ behavior (“9 out of 10 people chose this”) to trigger conformity.
40. **Reciprocity Principle**: Giving a small gift or favor to create a sense of obligation to return the favor.
41. **Stockholm Syndrome**: A trauma response where hostages or victims develop empathy or loyalty toward their captors.

## Cognitive Biases

### Cognition & Judgment
* **Curse of knowledge**: You forget what it was like to *not* know something—and therefore overestimate how much others understand.
* **Blind Spot Bias**: You believe that you are less affected by bias than others (meta-irony in the form of bias).
* **Information Bias**: You want more information, even if it is irrelevant to your decision.
* **Ambiguity Effect**: You avoid options whose probabilities are unclear.
* **Belief Bias**: You evaluate an argument based on whether you believe the conclusion – not on logic.
* **Base rate fallacy**: You ignore the base probability in favor of conspicuous (but rare) characteristics.
* **Zero-risk bias**: You prefer to eliminate a small risk entirely rather than greatly reduce a large one.
* **Disposition Effect**: In the financial world, you prefer to sell profitable investments rather than loss-making ones, even though this is irrational.
* **Hard-Easy Effect**: You underestimate difficult tasks and overestimate easy ones.
* **Motivated Reasoning**: Interpreting evidence to fit desired conclusions.  
* **Narrative Fallacy**: Preferring coherent stories over complex or random truths.

### Illusions & Perceptual Errors
* **Illusory Superiority** (Above-Average Effect): You consider yourself above average in many things – mathematically impossible.
* **Illusory Correlation**: You perceive connections where there are none (e.g., stereotypical connections).
* **Illusion of Validity**: You are convinced that your predictions are accurate – even if they are based on weak data.
* **Placebo Effect**: You feel an effect simply because you expect it.
* **Nocebo Effect**: The opposite of the placebo effect – you experience *negative* effects simply because you expect them.
* **Mere Exposure Effect**: Repeated stimuli seem more familiar and therefore more positive.
* **Recency Illusion**: You think a phenomenon is new just because you have only just discovered it.
* **Hot-Hand Fallacy**: You believe that a player is on a “winning streak” – even though the statistics say otherwise.
* **Clustering Illusion**: You see patterns in random events even though none exist.

### Social Effects & Biases
* **Pygmalion Effect**: Higher expectations lead to better performance (also known as a self-fulfilling prophecy).
* **Golem Effect**: Low expectations lead to poorer performance.
* **False uniqueness effect**: You underestimate how many people have the same positive qualities as you.
* **Projection bias**: You assume that others think, feel, or act like you.

### Economic & Consumer Biases
* **IKEA effect**: You value things that you have (partly) built yourself more highly.
* **Money illusion**: You value money nominally, not in real terms (e.g., “higher salary” despite higher inflation).
* **Projection Bias (Market Behavior)**: You believe that your current needs will remain the same in the future (e.g., buying a full refrigerator when you are hungry).
* **Unit Bias**: You consider a portion to be “normal” simply because that is how it is served—regardless of calories, etc.
* **Default bias**: You stick with default settings (e.g., data protection in apps) because it requires the least effort.
* **Time-saving bias**: You overestimate how much time you save by increasing your speed (e.g., driving 30 km/h faster makes little difference over a short distance).
- **Choice-Supportive Bias**: Remembering chosen options as better than they were.

### Science & Statistics
* **Publication Bias**: Studies with positive results are published more often than those with negative results.
* **Survivorship Bias**: You only analyze the “survivors” and ignore those who did not make it (e.g., successful startups).
* **Sampling Bias**: The selection of your sample distorts the results (e.g., only surveying Twitter users).
* **Observer Expectancy Effect**: Your expectations as a researcher unconsciously influence the results.
* **Reactivity (Hawthorne Effect)**: People change their behavior when they know they are being observed.
- **File Drawer Problem** *(related to publication bias)*: describes the bias in scientific literature, as studies with non-significant or negative results are published less frequently, thereby creating an exaggeratedly positive picture of an effect.
* **Reproducibility bias**: Studies that are difficult to replicate are often overlooked—even though they would be important.

### Attention & Perception
* **Spotlight Effect**: You think others pay much more attention to you than they actually do.
* **Illusion of Transparency**: You believe that your thoughts or feelings are easily recognizable to others.
* **Change Blindness**: You overlook obvious changes when your attention is elsewhere.

* **Negativity bias**: Negative information influences you more than positive information.


### Memory Biases
* **Hindsight Bias** (“I knew it all along”): In retrospect, everything seems much more predictable than it really was.
* **Mandela Effect**: Many people collectively remember something incorrectly (e.g., “Berenstain Bears” vs. “Berenstein”).
* **Peak-End Rule**: You evaluate experiences based on the most emotionally intense moment and the end – not on the average.
* **Misattribution of Memory**: You remember something, but confuse the source or mix up details.
* **False Memory**: You remember things that never happened.
* **Recency Effect**: You remember the last piece of information in a series better.
* **Primacy Effect**: You remember the first piece of information better.

### Decision-Making Biases
* **Confirmation Bias**: You specifically look for information that confirms your opinion.
* **Anchoring Bias**: Initial information has a disproportionate influence on your judgment.
* **Availability Heuristic**: You assess probabilities based on how easily you can think of examples.
* **Representativeness Heuristic**: You consider something more likely because it fits a stereotype.
* **Gambler's Fallacy**: You believe that random events have a “memory” (e.g., “A 6 has to come up soon”).
* **Sunk Cost Fallacy**: You keep going because you have already invested a lot—even though it would be more rational to stop.
* **Framing Effect**: How something is presented influences your decision (e.g., 90% chance of survival vs. 10% risk of death).
* **Loss Aversion**: Losses weigh more heavily psychologically than gains of equal magnitude.
- **Affect Heuristic**: Your spontaneous feelings (sympathy, fear, disgust, etc.) influence decisions more than objective facts or probabilities.

* **Overconfidence Bias**: You are overly confident in your own judgments or abilities.
* **Moral Licensing**: After doing a “good deed,” you feel freer to do something morally questionable.
- **Present Bias**: Overvaluing immediate rewards over future benefits.

### Standalone Important Biases
* **Conjunction Fallacy**: You consider a specific combination (e.g., “bank employee and feminist”) to be more likely than the more general option (“just a bank employee”) – even though this is mathematically impossible.
* **Regression to the Mean**: Extreme values (e.g., very poor or very good performance) tend to regress toward the mean statistically when repeated – but we often interpret this as a real trend or effect.
* **Reactance**: hen people feel their freedom is threatened, they may do the opposite of what’s requested—manipulators may *pretend* to restrict choice to trigger this and push someone toward the desired action.
